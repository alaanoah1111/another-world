      <h2 id=Intro> Intro </h2>
      <p>Our challenge is to create our own habitable world that can expand the scope of life and future human exploration, our expectation and design may help the scientists to achieve their hope in finding a suitable planet for life. And we decided to make a website and present the data we find in an easy way to facilitate to the reader understanding website content, this website may help many people to understand what is necessary to be in any place or planet to be habitable and suitable for life being. Our solution can make the reader excited to know more about habitable planets and search more and more it, which can be a reason for a huge discovery in the future.</p>

       <p><b>Suitable Distance from a Star:</b> It's generally believed that a planet should orbit within the habitable zone of its star, also known as the "Goldilocks zone," where conditions are favorable for liquid water to exist. This criterion is often considered crucial, accounting for around 40% of the overall habitability assessment.<br>

<br><b>Presence of Water:</b> Liquid water is essential for life as we know it. The availability of water, including oceans, lakes, and water vapor in the atmosphere, is considered vital, contributing to approximately 30% of the habitability rating.<br>

<br><b>Atmosphere and Climate:</b> A planet's atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating temperature, protecting against harmful radiation, and facilitating essential processes. A stable atmosphere with a suitable composition, including the presence of necessary gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, accounts for roughly 20% of habitability.<br>

<br><b>Composition and Geology:</b> The planet's composition and geology influence its ability to support life. Factors such as a solid surface, suitable geological activity (e.g., plate tectonics), and the presence of essential elements and minerals contribute to approximately 10% of habitability.<br>

<br><b>Stability and Continuity:</b> A habitable planet should exhibit long-term stability and continuity in its climate, geology, and other environmental factors. This ensures that ecosystems can develop and sustain life over extended periods. Stability and continuity contribute to approximately 10% of habitability.<br>

It's important to note that these percentages are rough estimates and can vary depending on scientific opinions and ongoing research. Additionally, different studies and models may assign different weights to these criteria. The search for habitable planets and the understanding of habitability factors are continuously evolving fields, with new discoveries and insights shaping our understanding.<br></p>

      <h2 id=water percentage>water percentage </h2>
      <p>the percentage of water on the planet is 65% distributed to 85% salty water and 15 % fresh water.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id=Fertility of water> Fertility of water </h2>
      <p>Nutrient Addition: Adding specific nutrients to the soil can enhance its fertility. This can be achieved through the application of organic matter (compost, manure) or inorganic fertilizers that contain the necessary elements. Care must be taken to ensure proper application rates and avoid overloading the soil with excessive nutrients, which can lead to environmental issues pH Adjustment: Soil pH influences nutrient availability to plants. Modifying soil pH through the addition of lime (to raise pH) or elemental sulfur (to lower pH) can optimize nutrient uptake by plants Soil Erosion Control: Preventing soil erosion helps retain nutrients in the soil. Implementing erosion control measures, such as contour plowing, terracing, or planting windbreaks, can protect the topsoil and maintain nutrient-rich layers</p>

      <h2 id=Planet's Energy>Planet's Energy </h2>

      <p><b>External Energy:</b> This refers to the energy received from the planet's parent star, typically in the form of sunlight. The amount and type of energy received depend on the planet's distance from its star and the star's characteristics. The energy from the star enables processes such as photosynthesis, which is crucial for supporting life as we know it on Earth.<br><b>Internal Energy:</b> This refers to the planet's internal heat, which is generated by various sources such as radioactive decay, residual heat from its formation, and ongoing geothermal activity. Internal heat plays a vital role in maintaining a planet's geological activity, including plate tectonics, volcanism, and the cycling of materials necessary for life.</p>

      <h2 id=The Atmosphere>The Atmosphere </h2>
      <p>Suitable Atmospheric Composition: The planet should have an atmosphere that can retain heat, regulate temperature, and provide protection from harmful radiation. The presence of an atmosphere also allows for the cycling of gases, nutrients, and the maintenance of a stable climate.<br><br>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a significant greenhouse gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that helps to regulate the Earth's temperature and make it habitable for life. However, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.<br><br>When sunlight reaches the Earth's surface, some of it is absorbed and warms the planet. The Earth then radiates heat back into space in the form of infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, including CO2, trap some of this outgoing heat energy and prevent it from escaping into space. This trapped heat leads to an increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, known as global warming.<br><br>The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere acts as a "control knob" for the greenhouse effect. When there is a higher concentration of CO2, more heat is trapped, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This phenomenon is often referred to as anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change<br><br>Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change are crucial in regulating the greenhouse effect and preventing further global warming. Various strategies include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, implementing carbon capture and storage technologies, and promoting sustainable land use practices.<br><br>The ozone layer is a region of the Earth's stratosphere that contains a higher concentration of ozone (O3) molecules compared to other parts of the atmosphere. It is located approximately 10 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing the majority of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</p>

<h2>Technology: </h2>
<p>
We suggest to make the planet another place that has all the facilities which will help all of us in different fields that will be by the use of AI, so that we have decided to apply technology and artificial intelligence. The appliance will play roles and there are the roles:
  <br>
•  Solar glass. This is the emerging environmental technology that would do wonders for the environment. <br>


•  Electric cars, to make zero pollution in order to stop climate change. <br>
•  Smart homes.  <br>
•  Plastic derived from plants in order to stop pollution that hurts all living organisms. <br>
•  Going paperless. <br>
•  Renewable energy.  <br>
•  Eco friendly batteries. <br>

      <h2 id=Conclusion>Conclusion </h2>
      <p>To sum up, the idea of our imaginary habitable planet that it is exactly like the earth, for instance it will be the same soil, gravity, pressure, and atmosphere layers, but the difference that it is without the problems that faces us in our real planet, in our solution, we tried to know what are the reasons for all these problems and avoid existing these reasons in the new world. From these problems of the ozone layer, fossil fuels as a source of energy and water distribution.</p>
